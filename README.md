## Usage:

Due to the image has `trimgalore` as entry point, calling `docker run` will return the help text:

```
$ docker run --rm -it imetools/trimgalore:v0.4.5
###
###    USAGE:
###
###   trim_galore [options] <filename(s)>
###
###
###   -h/--help               Print this help message and exits.
###
###   -v/--version            Print the version information and exits.
###
###   -q/--quality <INT>      Trim low-quality ends from reads in addition to adapter removal. For
###                           RRBS samples, quality trimming will be performed first, and adapter
###                           trimming is carried in a second round. Other files are quality and adapter
###                           trimmed in a single pass. The algorithm is the same as the one used by BWA
###                           (Subtract INT from all qualities; compute partial sums from all indices
###                           to the end of the sequence; cut sequence at the index at which the sum is
###                           minimal). Default Phred score: 20.
###
###   --phred33               Instructs Cutadapt to use ASCII+33 quality scores as Phred scores
###                           (Sanger/Illumina 1.9+ encoding) for quality trimming. Default: ON.
[...]

```

The version of `trimgalore` is returned, if `--version` is used as command:

```
$ docker run --rm -it imetools/trimgalore:v0.4.5 --version
